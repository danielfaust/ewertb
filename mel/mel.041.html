<h2 class="body">How do I replicate the Frame Selected and Frame All hotkey functions in MEL?</h2>
<!-- How do I replicate the Frame Selected and Frame All hotkey functions in MEL? -->

<p>Maya's built-in command for this is viewFit.  You will need the object(s)
in the selection list to be able to frame only specific items in the view.</p>

<p>For example, to "frame selected" only "pSphere1" in the current camera view:</p>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
select -r pSphere1;
viewFit;
</PRE>

<p>To "frame all" in the current camera view:</p>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
viewFit -all;
</PRE>

<P>The internal MEL script that Maya calls with the ‘<CODE>f</CODE>’ or ‘<CODE>a</CODE>’ key is
"<CODE>fitPanel.mel</CODE>".  It takes a string argument -- either "<CODE>&minus;all</CODE>" or "<CODE>&minus;selected</CODE>"
(although anything other than "<CODE>&minus;all</CODE>" counts as "<CODE>&minus;selected</CODE>").</P>

<P>This script takes care of the differences between the model views and the various editors/panels.  These editors have their own commands for framing selected items.</P>

<P>To conclude, the script command you would want to include in your scripts is:</P>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Frame selected only in panel under mouse pointer</SPAN>
fitPanel -selected;
</PRE>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Frame all in panel under mouse pointer</SPAN>
fitPanel -all;
</PRE>

<P>The ‘<CODE>fitPanel</CODE>’ procedure uses the panel under the mouse pointer, irregardless of whether it has active focus.</P>

<BR>

<DIV CLASS="heading">
<P>Framing Control For Arbitrary Panels</P>
</DIV>

What if you want to perform a "fit" for a specific panel instead of relying on the user to float the mouse pointer in your direction?  In this case, you will need to:

<OL>
  <LI><P>Find the instance(s) of the panel currently available.</P></LI>
  <LI><P>Determine which instance is the one you want to process.</P></LI>
  <LI><P>Use the panel type's command syntax to perform the necessary view fit.</P></LI>
</OL>

<P>Some of these steps are utilized in the "<CODE>fitPanel.mel</CODE>" script, and these are the reasons for this function.</P>

<BR>

<DIV CLASS="heading">
<P>Examples</P>
</DIV>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ui"><B>Perspective Camera</B> (or any Camera, really)</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="in">
  <P>Conveniently, we don't have to bother with the first two steps here.  When dealing with a camera view you can use the 'viewFit' command which accepts the name of a camera.</P>

  <OL>
    <LI>
    <P><SPAN CLASS="comment">Find the instance(s) of the panel currently available.</SPAN></P>
    </LI>

    <LI>
    <P><SPAN CLASS="comment">Determine which instance is the one you want to process.</SPAN></P>
    </LI>

    <LI>
    <P>Use that panel's type's command syntax to perform the necessary view fit.</P>

  <PRE CLASS="mel">
  <SPAN CLASS="comment">// Frame the selected items in the persp camera view</SPAN>
  viewFit persp;
  </PRE>

    </LI>
  </OL>
</DIV>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ui"><B>HyperGraph</B></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="in">
  <OL>
    <LI>
    <P>Find the instance(s) of the panel currently available.</P>
    </LI>

  <PRE CLASS="mel">
  string $hyperGraphPanels[] = `getPanel -scriptType hyperGraphPanel`;
  // Result: hyperGraphPanel1 hyperGraphPanel2 //
  </PRE>

  <LI>
    <P>Determine which instance is the one you want to process.</P>

    <P>The main HyperGraph panel is labelled "Hypergraph"; tearoff copies are named "Hyper Graph Panel 2", etc.</P>
    </LI>

  <PRE CLASS="mel">
  string $mainHyperGraph = "";
  for ( $panel in $hyperGraphPanels )
  {
    <SPAN CLASS="comment">// Looking for the main HyperGraph panel</SPAN>
    if ( "Hypergraph" == `scriptedPanel -q -label $panel` )
    {
      $mainHyperGraph = $panel;
      break;
    }
  }
  // Result: hyperGraphPanel1 //
  </PRE>

    <LI>
    <P>Use that panel's type's command syntax to perform the necessary view fit.</P>

    <P>In the case of the HyperGraph the MEL command used is ‘<CODE>hyperGraph</CODE>’.  However, its use here requires a little trickery.  The HyperGraph you live and work with is actually a ‘<CODE>hyperPanel</CODE>’ object within a <CODE>scriptedPanel</CODE>.  The name we have found is the scriptedPanel.  By convention Maya names the hyperPanel editor by appending the string "HyperGraphEd" to the name of the panel.</P>

  <PRE CLASS="mel">
  <SPAN CLASS="comment">// Assert that we've found our desired HyperGraph panel</SPAN>
  if ( "" != $mainHyperGraph )
  {
    string $hyperGraphEditor = ( $mainHyperGraph + "HyperGraphEd" );
    <SPAN CLASS="comment">// Frame selected items in the HyperGraph</SPAN>
    hyperGraph -e -frame $hyperGraphEditor;

    <SPAN CLASS="comment">// To frame all items the command syntax is:</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="comment">// hyperGraph -e -frameGraph ...</SPAN>
  }
  </PRE>

    </LI>

  </OL>

  <P><SPAN CLASS="note">Note</SPAN>: You use the same technique to frame the selected items in the HyperShade Editor.  You would use the ‘<CODE>hyperGraph</CODE>’ command, but would append the string "HyperShadeEd" instead of "HyperGraphEd".</P>

</DIV>

<P><SPAN CLASS="ui"><B>Graph Editor</B></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="in">
  <P>The Graph Editor is also a scriptedPanel:</P>

  <OL>
    <LI>
    <P>Find the instance(s) of the panel currently available.</P>
    </LI>

  <PRE CLASS="mel">
  string $graphEditors[] = `getPanel -scriptType graphEditor`;
  // Result: graphEditor1 graphEditor2 //
  </PRE>

  <LI>
    <P>Determine which instance is the one you want to process.</P>

    <P>The main Graph Editor is labelled "Graph Editor"; tearoff copies are named "Graph Editor 2", etc.</P>
    </LI>

  <PRE CLASS="mel">
  string $mainGraphEditor = "";
  for ( $panel in $graphEditors )
  {
    <SPAN CLASS="comment">// Looking for the main Graph Editor</SPAN>
    if ( "Graph Editor" == `scriptedPanel -q -label $panel` )
    {
      $mainGraphEditor = $panel;

    }
  }
  // Result: graphEditor1 //
  </PRE>

    <LI>
    <P>Use that panel's type's command syntax to perform the necessary view fit.</P>

    <P>Again, similar trickery as the Graph Editor is presented as a scriptedPanel and Maya identifies the embedded editor by appending to its name the string "GraphEd".  This time the panel is accessed by the MEL command ‘<CODE>animCurveEditor</CODE>’.</P>

  <PRE CLASS="mel">
  if ( "" != $mainGraphEditor )
  {
    string $graphEditor = ( $mainGraphEditor + "GraphEd" );
    animCurveEditor -e -lookAt selected $graphEditor;

    <SPAN CLASS="comment">// To frame all items the command syntax is:</SPAN>
    <SPAN CLASS="comment">// animCurveEditor -e -lookAt all ...</SPAN>
  }
  </PRE>

    </LI>

  </OL>
</DIV>

<P><SPAN CLASS="note">NOTE</SPAN>: All of this from Maya v2.5.1.  No idea if any of this changed for v3.0</P>
