<!-- What is the best way to start learning how to write MEL scripts? -->

<P>First I'll tell you my background in scripting and coding:</P>

<P>I started with learning BASIC on the Commodore PET machines, circa 1982.  In 1983 I bought a VIC-20 and continued BASIC programming.  I moved up through the C-64 and the Amiga, where I finally tackled learning C.  Once I got into PC-land, I tried my hand at plug-ins for Lightwave, C++ and Java.</P>

<P>From there, MEL was fairly easy to pick up, but consider that was with 15 years of former scripting/programming experience.</P>

<P>MEL has a lot of qualities that are similar to the C programming language, and not as much similar to the Commodore BASIC derivative that I learned.  Based on my experience, any knowledge of C helps a great deal when learning MEL.  Any C++ extensions to the language, e.g. object-oriented coding, contructor/destructor methods, and overloaded functions, are not at all applicable to MEL.</P>

<P>My best advice, if you don't want to learn a whole programming language just to do some MEL scripting, is to dissect any and all MEL scripts that interest you and figure out how and why they work.  <A HREF="mel.001.html">I expand on this in another How-To.</A>  Add a lot of &lsquo;<CODE>print</CODE>&rsquo; commands to your own scripts to follow what happens as the script progresses.  And, of course, there's always the <A HREF="http://www.highend3d.com/maya/listserver/">Maya Mailing List</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.highend3d.com/messageboards/forum.pl">Highend3D.com forums</A> to ask questions when something doesn't make sense.</P>

<P>Have fun!</P>
