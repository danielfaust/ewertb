<h2 class="body">How do I store a value or string such that it is saved and restored with the current scene?</h2>
<p>There are myriad ways to store custom data in a scene file. The only specific thing that you need to remember is this:</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p>Everything Maya stores in a scene file must be part of its dependency graph. Thus, it must
exist as a node, an attribute on a node, or a connection between nodes.</p>
</div>

<p>Over the years there have been several suggestions from Maya users on this topic. Each has its own merits and possible
limitations; you'll need to decide which is best for your application.</p>

<p><span class="heading">Custom Attributes</span></p>

<p>The easiest method is to simply pick a node and create a custom dynamic attribute. This attribute
can be of numeric or string form and you can save your data in any form you choose, provided
its a valid form for Maya's attribute types.</p>

<p>The key limitation to this method is that it is prone to user deletion. If the node to which you add
your data is a DAG node then it will appear in Maya's Outliner, Hypergraph and camera views. If the
user can select it, then the user can delete it.</p>

<p><SPAN CLASS="note">Note:</SPAN> Maya 5.0 introduced functions within the API to lock nodes or attributes so as to make
them read-only.</p>

<p><span class="heading">The "Unknown" Node</span></p>

<p>Another popular method is to use an "unknown" node. <span class="remark">(No, I'm not kidding - Maya allows you to create
a node of type "unknown".)</span></p>

<p>This is similar to the "Custom Attributes" method above, except that this
node will not appear in Maya's DAG and will be a less obvious target for a tired artist to blow
away during crunch time. The flip-side to this is that it requires more effort to find if the data
needs to be edited; you'll likely want to offer a custom UI for the user's convenience.</p>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Create an "unknown" node.</SPAN>
string $unknown = `createNode -name "_sceneNotes" "unknown"`;

<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Add two attributes.</SPAN>
addAttr -dt "string" -ln "rigComment" $unknown;
addAttr -at "float" -ln "strideDistance" $unknown;

<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Assign values to the attributes.</SPAN>
setAttr -type "string" ( $unknown + ".rigComment" ) "This rig is ready for animating.";
setAttr ( $unknown + ".strideDistance" ) 0.65;
</PRE>

<p><SPAN CLASS="note">Note:</SPAN> There is no way to distinguish one "unknown" node from another (other than by name).
Maya uses this node type to preserve node information when a scene is loaded containing data of an unknown type (from
a plug-in, for example). Be sure to identify your own data node using a unique name rather than relying on finding any
"unknown" node in the scene.</p>

<p><span class="heading">The Camera Hack</span></p>

<p>A common hack to prevent user data from being inadvertantly deleted is to use one of Maya's default cameras -
persp, top, front or side - and add a custom attribute with which to store your data. This is reasonably safe
because the default cameras are read-only and Maya does not allow them to be deleted.</p>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Find Maya's default camera.</SPAN>
string $camera = findStartUpCamera( "persp" );

<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Add two attributes.</SPAN>
addAttr -dt "string" -ln "rigComment" $camera;
addAttr -at "float" -ln "strideDistance" $camera;

<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Assign values to the attributes.</SPAN>
setAttr -type "string" ( $camera + ".rigComment" ) "This rig is ready for animating.";
setAttr ( $camera + ".strideDistance" ) 0.65;
</PRE>

<p><SPAN CLASS="note">Note:</SPAN> The "findStartUpCamera" command returns the name for the camera's <em>transform</em> and not the shape.</p>

<p><span class="heading">The Custom Node</span></p>

<p>By using the API to create a custom node type you can define the attribute structure which will
store your data. These attributes are part of the node's definition and cannot be changed. Nor do
they need to be added as dynamic attributes using the "addAttr" MEL command. Simply create your
custom node and all of the necessary attributes are immediately available.</p>

<p>This also offers the convenience of identification. There is no ambiguity in the purpose for the node,
and you don't need to rely on naming schemes.</p>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
string $myCustomNodes[] = `ls -type "myCustomNode"`;
</PRE>


<p><span class="heading">The ".notes" Attribute</span></p>

<p>Maya 4.5 added the ability to assign notes to each node from the Attribute Editor. These notes
are stored on the '.notes' attribute for each node (imagine that!).</p>

<P>Be aware that this attribute is added dynamically, and does not exist until a non-empty note
has been assigned to the node. If you are managing this attribute yourself you'll need to determine
if the attribute exists, and add it if necessary.</P>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
string $targetNode = "someNodeInYourScene";

<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Add the ".notes" attribute if it doesn't exist.</SPAN>
if ( !`attributeQuery -node $targetNode -exists "notes"` )
{
  addAttr -sn "nts" -ln "notes" -dt "string" $targetNode;
}

<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Assign the note.</SPAN>
setAttr -type "string" ( $targetNode + ".notes" )
  "This rig is ready for animating. The stride distance should be 0.65m";
</PRE>

<p><span class="heading">The "fileInfo" Command</span></p>

<p>In Maya 5.0 there's a new MEL command which may be used to - ta da! - "provides a mechanism for keeping information related to a Maya scene file."
The "fileInfo" command allows you to define keyword/value pairs that will be saved with the scene file.</p>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Assign two keyword/value pairs for the current scene.</SPAN>
fileInfo "rigComment" "This rig is ready for animating.";
fileInfo "strideDistance" "0.65";
</PRE>

<p>Note that the "value" in this case is always a string, but you can store numerical data in this string as well, if desired.</p>


<p><span class="heading">The "scriptNode"</span></p>

<p>If you wish to associate an action along with the value you may consider defining a "scriptNode" in the scene.
This node allows you to define MEL commands which execute when a scene is loaded. These commands could, for example,
assign values to a common UI, or could generate their own UI.</p>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
<SPAN CLASS="comment">// The command will prompt the user loading the scene...</SPAN>
string $command = "confirmDialog -message \"This rig is ready for animating.\" -button \"OK\";";
<SPAN CLASS="comment">// ... and will update a value in an artist's control panel.</SPAN>
$command = $command + "if ( `floatField -q -exists strideDistanceUI` ) " +
                      "floatField -e -value 0.65 strideDistanceUI;";

<SPAN CLASS="comment">// Create a scriptNode to execute when this scene is loaded.</SPAN>
scriptNode -scriptType 2 -beforeScript $command -name "_sceneConfig";
</PRE>

<p><span class="heading">Blind Data</span></p>

<p>You can use blind data to store custom data values directly to individual polygon components, or to any DAG object.</p>

<p>This has the advantage of allowing your geometry to carry your custom data with it when imported or referenced,
without interfering with, nor overwriting, any custom data you may have already applied in your working scene.</p>

<p>Using blind data carries more of a burden, however. The commands to apply blind data are more complex
than for simple attributes, and you'll need a custom UI for your artists to manage the application of blind data.
Also, in contrast to attributes, blind data is applied partly via construction history, which means its use
will potentially impact the complexity of the dependency graph for your scene. Finally, blind data queries
can be painfully slow (particularly the selection and false colouring mechanism).</p>

<p><SPAN CLASS="note">Warning!</SPAN> A unfortunate limitation of blind data arises from the fact that it is stored as attributes - either on
the geometry itself, or on polyBlindData nodes connected to the object. One of Maya's scene optimizations is
to not store attributes whose current value is equal to its default value. Thus, if you apply blind data using
its default value, Maya <em>will not save this data</em>. Always define your blind data using default values
that are <em>not intended to be applied to your scene</em>.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p>A bit of trivia: Maya's Blind Data Editor was never intended to be the primary editor for blind data. It
was offered as an example for how to create and modify blind data - more as a documentation supplement than
an official part of Maya's UI. Alias admits that this editor is a little "rough"
(that's putting it mildly) but its overhaul and replacement has, so far, not been a priority. The topic of blind data
is a popular one at Alias' developer classes, a testiment to the fact that many users find this feature
of Maya to be a tad bewildering.</p>
