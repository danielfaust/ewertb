<!-- How do I execute MEL commands from the API? And <EM>why</EM> would I want or need to execute MEL from the API? -->

<P>Yes, it is possible to execute MEL commands from the API. Sometimes it's a
convenience, but there are times you have no other choice. There are two
methods in the API for this purpose:</P>

<PRE CLASS="api">
MGlobal::executeCommand()
MDGModifier::commandToExecute()
</PRE>

<P>The difference between these two is how the Undo is handled. Refer to this
useful reply from Dean Edmonds in the Maya Developer's Mailing List:</P>

<PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.highend3d.com/maya/devarchive/sp.3d?mail_id=3583">http://www.highend3d.com/maya/devarchive/sp.3d?mail_id=3583</A>
</PRE>

<p>To pr–πcis: You can use <SPAN CLASS="api">MDGModifier::commandToExecute()</SPAN> to "stack"
MEL commands so that a series is controllable through a single undo/redo event.
Using <SPAN CLASS="api">MGlobal::executeCommand()</SPAN>, each MEL command creates
an additional undo/redo event. If you are executing many small or iterative commands it would
be inconvenient for the user to require multiple undos, and filling up the
queue means that it would be impossible for the user to completely undo to
a previous state.</p>

<P>There are a few cases that spring to mind where calling MEL is the only way
out:</P>

<P CLASS="topic">1. User Interface</P>

<P CLASS="in">Maya's UI control is handled exclusively via MEL. The API
offers no access to generating, editing or querying windows, layouts or
controls. For the most part you'll want to create separate MEL scripts to
manage your UI, and limit the API involvement to simply querying states and
such. In other words, don't try to build and manage a UI using
MGlobal::executeCommand() calls.</P>

<P CLASS="topic">2. Preferences</P>

<P CLASS="in">There is no API equivalent to the "optionVar" MEL command.
If you want to query or set user preferences from within your plug-in you'll
need to do via MEL.</P>

<P CLASS="topic">3. componentListData</P>

<P CLASS="in">Here's one interesting attribute type. From what I've been able to determine, a 'componentListData'
attribute type can only be queried via the API, and can only be set via MEL.</P>


<P>In the sake of convenience, it typically boils down to: "How much work are
you willing to do?" Take the &lsquo;<CODE>polyMapCut</CODE>&rsquo; command for example. Yes, it's
possible to replicate its behavior using only API calls - provided you want
to deal with introducing contruction history, generating the intermediate
mesh, wiring up all the plug dependencies, and populating the polymapCut node
(which, incidentally, uses a "componentListData" attribute)
to describe the edges you wish to cut.</P>

<P>Or you can simply call, for example:</P>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
polyMapCut -ch 1 pPlane1.e[18];
</PRE>

<P>And let Maya take care of all that.</P>

<P>Doing it the "hard way" provided me the opportunity to create a convenient
library for introducting construction history on a mesh, and for managing
undo/redo - both of which were handy when used on other projects. But if I
was building a simple "one off" tool for an artist, I'd likely simply call
MEL to do it.</P>
