<H3>Function</H3>

<P>Determines the Shading Groups and File textures that
shade the selected polygon facet components, and highlights
the appropriate nodes in the MultiLister.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P>Select one or more facet components on a polygon object,
then call ‘<CODE>selectFacetSG</CODE>’.  The script determines which
Shading Groups are used to shade the selected facets.
These Shading Groups will be highlighted in the MultiLister.</P>

<P>Next, the input color connection for each Shading Group is
checked and, if the color is derived from a File texture
node, that File node will also be highlighted.</P>

<P>If the MultiLister is in Select Mode, as opposed to Highlight
Mode, the appropriate nodes will be selected instead of
highlighted.</P>
