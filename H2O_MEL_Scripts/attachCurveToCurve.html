<P CLASS="title">attachCurveToCurve</P>

<H3>Function</H3>

<P>Given two NURBS curves, moves the first-selected curve so that it is aligned with the second-selected curve.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P>Draw two curves anywhere in 3D space.
   Say you need the second curve you created to align perfectly
   with the first curve.  Select the second curve, then 
   select the first curve.  Call ‘<CODE>attachCurveToCurve</CODE>’.
   The second curve is moved and rotated so that its "head" CV
   is at the same world coordinate as the other's "tail" CV,
   and it is aligned tangentally with the first.</P>
