<P CLASS="note">Both functions are accessed from the MEL script ‘<CODE>copyKey2.mel</CODE>’.</P>

<H3>Function</H3>

<P>These functions behave almost identically to the Copy and Paste functions accessed from the Time Slider (in fact, 95% of the script is just copied and pasted from the Time Slider functions :).</P>

<P>What's different, though, is that these functions allow for "smart" pasting.  There was a thread on the Maya Mailing List discussing the problem with copying and pasting keys within the Time Slider:</P>

<PRE>
> how do you set it up so that if you cut and paste keys in the time slider,
> when you paste it doesn't offset all the keys after the one you pasted?
</PRE>

<P>Using pasteKeys2 it is now possible to copy from the Time Slider, then paste <I>without shifting keys</I>.</P>

<P>Now you can scrub to a keyframe, use copyKey2, scrub to the new location, then pasteKey2.  The key's value and tangents will be pasted at the new time without shifting the time values of later keys.</P>

<P>If you copy a single key (ie. with no highlighted range in the Time Slider), the Paste operation will replace only the key at the current time.  If you copy a range of keys then the Paste operation will replace all keys from the current time for the length of the copied range.</P>

<P>Note that keys <I>must</I> be copied using copyKey2 for pasteKey2 to function properly.</P>

<P>You'll have to assign hotkeys (or a similarly convenient access) to these commands; they are not linked to the Time Slider Menus.</P>
