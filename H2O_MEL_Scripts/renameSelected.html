<H3>Function</H3>

<P>I wanted a hotkey to rename selected objects.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<IMG SRC="renameSelected.gif" ALT="Rename" WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=78 ALIGN="right">

<P>Select one or more nodes.  A dialog will be presented
to allow you to enter a new name. If you select a single
node then the node will be renamed appropriately.  If you
have selected multiple nodes then they will be renamed
as a numbered series using Maya's "#"-suffix renaming
feature.</P>

<P>Hit ENTER on the main keypad area to
highlight the entire string.  Press ENTER on the numeric
keypad to accept the new name.  Click the close gadget
for the window to cancel the naming operation.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="note">Note:</SPAN> This will work in the Multilister for <I>selected</I> items
but not for <I>highlighted</I> items.  A selected item is indicated by a
light blue border; a highlighted item is indicated by an orange border.</P>

<P>I have this mapped to ‘<CODE>CTRL-r</CODE>’.</P>
