<P CLASS="title">replaceCamera</P>

<H3>Preamble</H3>

<P>I occasionally have the occurance where a camera can "go funky" on me and behave erratically while tumbling; the camera refuses to stay focused on the desired elements.  For example, performing a Frame Selected would properly frame the selected object, as soon as I begin a Tumble the object disappears from view.</P>

<P>I narrowed this down to (possibly) a corruption of the camera transform's World Rotate and World Scale Pivots, but I haven't find a way to restore these to "normal" operation.  So, I chose to simply replace the camera with a brand new one.</P>

<H3>Function</H3>

<P>This script replaces the specified camera, copying the position, rotation and visibility from the original.  All other attributes assume the defaults for a new camera.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<PRE>
replaceCamera «camera»;
</PRE>

Where <CODE>«camera»</CODE> is the name of the camera to replace, e.g. "persp".</P>

<H3>Example</H3>

<PRE CLASS="mel">
replaceCamera persp;
// Result: Camera successfully replaced. //
</PRE>
