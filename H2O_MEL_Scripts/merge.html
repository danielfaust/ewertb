<H3>Function</H3>

<P>I've found an (almost) foolproof method for merging overlapping
  vertices and edges.  I've encapsulated that method into this script.
  Whenever you want to merge, just select the target components and type
  'merge'.  The script is optimized for Edge component selection, but
  Vertex components will work as well.  Technically, facets will as
  well, but the function is less optimized for this selection mode.</P>

<P>Sometimes the components won't merge correctly on the first try.
  Fortunately, a "feature" of the script is to expand the selection
  after the merge, so if it doesn't work the first time, just try it
  again right away.  If it still fails after repeated attempts, start
  over and select <I>only</I> the components that require merging.</P>

<P>If Maya still stubbornly refuses to merge, consider the following:</P>

<H3>Usage Requirements</H3>

<UL>
    <LI><P>The components must overlap perfectly (or damn close -- I specify
    a tolerance of 0.01).</P></LI>

   <LI><P>Maya cannot and will not merge adjacent facets with conflicting
    normals.  Make sure the normals for merging facets are facing the
    same way.</P></LI>

   <LI><P>Two common edges can only be merged if both are Open Edges.  Maya
      will not attempt to merge edges that are "winged" by geometry on
      both sides.</P></LI>

   <LI><P>Maya cannot merge vertices at the junction of "bowtie geometry."
      Think of two triangles meeting at their top points.  Because of the
      way Maya builds geometry internally, it is not possible to eliminate
      the common point for these two triangles.  Facets must share at
      least a full edge in order to merge common vertices.</P></LI>
