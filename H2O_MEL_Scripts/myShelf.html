<H3>Function</H3>

<P>My Shelf provides a floating, resizable, minimizable Shelf window.  As
my <SPAN CLASS="mel">tearoffShelf.mel</SPAN> proved to be unreliable, this is an interim
replacement.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P>My Shelf includes, by default, tools for quickly switching to the three
component highlight modes, and for toggling between Object and Component
Mode.  Initially, My Shelf provides five buttons with the following
functions:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Toggle between Object and Component Mode.</LI>
  <LI>Component Mode + Vertex Selection Mask.</LI>
  <LI>Component Mode + Edge Selection Mask.</LI>
  <LI>Component Mode + Facet Selection Mask.</LI>
  <LI>Component Mode + PolyUV Selection Mask.</LI>
  <LI>polyInfoWin (function from Kenneth Ibrahim)</LI>
</UL>

<P>This is a standard Maya Shelf.  You can drag and drop icons to and from
the main Shelf, and from or to the Shelf Editor.</P>

<P>A Popup Menu via the Right Mouse Button provides the option to Load or
Save My Shelf.  My Shelf will load the last-saved Shelf each time it is
started.</P>

<P>You must explicitly save My Shelf, as it cannot save itself.</P>

<P>The saved shelf is in the form of an executable MEL script:</P>

<PRE>
<Maya appdir>/prefs/shelf_MyShelf.mel
</PRE>

<P>To restore My Shelf to its initial five tools, select the <SPAN CLASS="ui">Revert to
Default</SPAN> menu item. This will clear the My Shelf and create the five
default buttons described above.  It will not overwrite your saved My
Shelf.  To switch back to your previously saved My Shelf use the <SPAN CLASS="ui">Load
My Shelf</SPAN> menu item, or quit and restart My Shelf.</P>

<P>To delete a My Shelf item, use the Middle Mouse Button to drag it on to
the "trashcan" on Maya's own Shelf bar.</P>

<P>My Shelf, as yet, does not support multiple tabs, nor the ability to
tweak its contents using an editor similar to Maya's Customize Shelves
panel.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="note">Note:</SPAN> Tool Buttons are not supported.  I tried, but dragging and
dropping a Tool from the "Sacred Tools" tray onto the My Shelf is
fraught with inconsistencies.</P>

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<P>This script requires the <SPAN CLASS="mel"><A HREF="abortTest.html">abortTest.mel</A></SPAN> script (a safeguard
during the <SPAN CLASS="mel">legalizeString()</SPAN> function).</P>
