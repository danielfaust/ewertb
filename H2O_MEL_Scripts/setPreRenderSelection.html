<P CLASS="title">setPreRenderSelection</P>

<H3>Function</H3>

<P>Sets the Render Globals' <SPAN CLASS="ui">Pre Render MEL</SPAN> attribute
to select the currently selected items.  This allows
shell-initiated renders to render only active items --
selection is not saved with the Scene file and must be explicitly
set with this MEL command for rendering.  The <SPAN CLASS="ui">Pre Render MEL</SPAN>
attribute <I>is</I> saved with the scene file, so this command is
not required every time you load the scene.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P>Select one or more items (don't forget lights, cameras
and texture placements) and call this function.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="note">Note:</SPAN> Calling this function more than once will <I>append</I>
the new selection command to the <SPAN CLASS="ui">Pre Render MEL</SPAN> attribute.
This behavior is by design so as to preserve existing
pre-render commands.  This will still work, as the MEL
command will simply replace the previous selection with
the new one.  Access the Render Globals via the Attribute
Editor if you want to clear the command.</P>
